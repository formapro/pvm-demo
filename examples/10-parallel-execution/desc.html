To tell the engine to process in parallel you have to mark a transition async and provide an AsyncTransition implementation.
It could be  a solution based on process forking or queue messaging.
<br>
PVM provides an integration with <a href="https://github.com/php-enqueue/enqueue-dev">Enqueue Messaging Library</a> to execute tasks in parallel.
Some extra packages have to be installed.
<br>
In the example above the foo task is executed in same process where bar is not, instead, the message is sent to the queue.
Then the message is picked up by a consumer and gets processed.

<h4>Setup</h4>

<pre><code>
mkdir ~/pvm-parallel-execution
cd ~/pvm-parallel-execution

composer req formapro/pvm:0.4.x-dev makasim/values:0.5.x-dev makasim/yadm:0.5.x-dev
composer req enqueue/simple-client:^0.8 enqueue/fs:^0.8 enqueue/enqueue:^0.8.33

# create such files with the code below
php parallel-execution.php
php handle-async-transition.php
</code></pre>

<h4>Result</h4>
