To tell the engine to process in parallel you have to mark a transition async and provide an AsyncTransition implementation.
It could be  a solution based on process forking or queue messaging.

PVM provides an integration with <a href="https://github.com/php-enqueue/enqueue-dev">Enqueue Messaging Library</a> to execute tasks in parallel.
Some extra packages have to be installed.


<pre><code>
$ composer req enqueue/simple-client enqueue/fs
</code></pre>

In the example above the foo task is executed in same process where bar is not, instead, the message is sent to the queue.
Then the message is picked up by a consumer and gets processed.
