The example shows how two tasks could be executed in parallel.</br></br>
Internally, by default the engine still executes tasks one by one because of the nature of PHP.
The tasks could be done in parallel for real if an async transition implementation is provided.
A solution could use message queue (MQ) or process forking in background.
